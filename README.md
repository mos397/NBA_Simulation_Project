# NBA-EDA-in-Databricks
This repository mainly contains one of my first explorations with Databricks using data from NBA.com. 

The [Data Acquisition notebook](https://github.com/mos397/NBA_Simulation_Project/blob/main/Code/1.NBA_Data_Acquisition.ipynb) was actually run on Google Colab, as the NBA API would not respond if run in Databricks or Jupyter Notebook at the time of exploration (October 2019).

The [Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/mos397/NBA_Simulation_Project/blob/main/Code/2.NBA_Exploratory_Analaysis.dbc) and the [Logisitic Regression](https://github.com/mos397/NBA_Simulation_Project/blob/main/Code/3.NBA_Logistic_Regression.dbc) files were run in Databricks, with both SQL and Python code.

The [Season Simulation](https://github.com/mos397/NBA_Simulation_Project/blob/main/Code/4.2Game%20Simulator%20Efficient-Pts_Normal-Final_Version.ipynb) was modeled off a Monte Carlo simulation and player stats distrubtions.
