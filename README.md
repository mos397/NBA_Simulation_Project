# NBA-EDA-in-Databricks
This repository mainly contains one of my first explorations with Databricks using data from NBA.com. 

The [Data Acquisition notebook](https://github.com/jentseng/NBA-EDA-in-Databricks/blob/master/1.NBA_Data_Acquisition.ipynb) was actually run on Google Colab, as the NBA API would not respond if run in Databricks or Jupyter Notebook at the time of exploration (October 2019).

The [Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/jentseng/NBA-EDA-in-Databricks/blob/master/2.NBA_Exploratory_Analaysis.sql) and the [Logisitic Regression](https://github.com/jentseng/NBA-EDA-in-Databricks/blob/master/3.NBA_Logistic_Regression.sql) files were run in Databricks, with both SQL and Python code, but exported as .sql files to be viewed on GitHub.
